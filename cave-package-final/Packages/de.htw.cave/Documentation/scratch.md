# Setup a project from scratch

## Profiles
The configuration is based on
[ScriptableObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScriptableObject.html).
Each configurable Behaviour references a special profile.
First of all you need to write down the architecture of your cave then you create
profiles accordingly to your architecture.
![GitHub Logo](profiles.png)
Profiles can be created by opening up the context menu of the folder which should
contain the profiles.

##### Projectors
For each projector in your cave create a `Projector Profile`.
Change the `Serialized Name` of the profile and leave the rest empty.

##### Render Manager
In order to get a stereoscopic effect and a holographic effect we need to setup
a `Render Manager Profile`. Leave it empty for now too.

##### Kinect Manager
To enable tracking in our environment create the `Kinect Manager Profile`.

## Scene Hierarchy
Our framework currently runs only on a single cave that is why you only need to
create a single empty GameObject which contains all of our cave logic called the `Cave Manager`.
The `Cave Manager` is made up of different behaviours and is the parent of all GameObjects that
interact directly with the cave.
The structure of your `Cave Manager` should look like this
```
Cave Manager
	Head
	Projector Mount
		Projector Emitter Front
		Projector Emitter Bottom
		...
	Projector Plane Front
	Projector Plane Bottom
	...
#####

```
>**Note**: If you want to know more about the different behaviours please take a
look at the code documentation.

##### Cave Manager
**Behaviours**
* Render Manager Initializer
* Render Manager Mono (optional)
* Render Manager Stereo (optional)
* Kinect Manager
* Profile Importer Exporter (optional)

##### Head
**Behaviours**
* Eyes

This object will be used to determine the eye positions for the stereo rendering
process inside the `Render Manager Stereo` or the mono rendering inside the
`Render Manager Mono`.

##### Projector Mount
**Behaviours**
* Projector Mount

Contains all `Projector Emitter` in the scene and should be following the tracked `Head`.

##### Projector Emitter ...
**Behaviours**
* Camera
* Screen Overlay
* Projector Emitter

Every single emitter renders a single display detail therefore need a camera.
The screen overlay removes all pixels not projected on the display.

##### Projector Plane ...
**Behaviours**
* Projector Plane

Defines the location and size of every display.
