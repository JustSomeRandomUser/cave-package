# Cave Automatic Virtual Environment Package

## About
This package contains several tools to build a cave environment with head, body
and basic face tracking capabilities. This package is designed to work with
multiple projectors which need to be configured manually.

The package follows the Unity package guidelines and requires the Unity Package
Manager (UPM) to work. If you need information about the Unity Package Manager
please visit [this](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@1.8/manual/index.html)
